Flight Phase Detection is a project focused on detecting and classifying different phases of flight for aircraft data. It aims to provide tools and algorithms for identifying key moments during the flight journey, such as takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, and landing.


## Introduction

Flight Phase Detection is a data-driven approach to recognize various stages of an aircraft's flight. It can be beneficial for various applications, including flight analysis, safety improvements, and aviation research.

## Features

- Automatic detection of key flight phases.
- Support for various data formats, such as CSV, JSON, or binary.
- Customizable parameters for fine-tuning detection algorithms.
- Example notebooks and tutorials for getting started quickly.
